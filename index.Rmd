I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley in the joint Ph.D. program in Sociology and Demography. My research focuses on (ir)rationality, pragmatism, decision-making, and immigration, and I use mixed methods approaches (demography, causal inference, and in-depth interviews). My principle region of interest is the American South. 

I was born in Guatemala, grew up in rural North Carolina, and now live in Berkeley, California. I received a B.S. in Statistical Science from Duke University in 2021.
