I am a third-year Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley in the joint Ph.D. program in Sociology and Demography. My research engages the sociology of immigration, ethnoracial classification/inequality/politics, urban sociology, demography, and social theory. I'm very interested in situating my research in the American South. I'm originally from rural North Carolina, but I was born in Guatemala. I received a B.S. in Statistical Science with a minor in Sociology from Duke University in 2021 and a M.A. in Demography from UC-Berkeley in 2023.
