Full Name: Rosvid Steven Herrera Tenorio | Pronouns: He/Him/His

I am a 4th-year undergraduate at Duke University, majoring in Statistical Science and minoring in Sociology. I've spent my past three summers researching [alt-right groups through the Data+ Program](https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/latinxs-and-right), interning as a [software engineer at Twitter](https://twitter.com/terns/status/1155956826342477824), and volunteering at the [Waipa Foundation in Hawaii](https://dukeengage.duke.edu/pineapples-in-the-kauai-garden/). My research interests focus broadly on the integration of immigrants (in neighborhood and occupation contexts) and the political and epistemological implications of identifying destinations that maximize upward mobility outcomes. I was born in Guatemala City, Guatemala, immigrated to a small, rural town in North Carolina called Sanford (where I grew up), and now live in Cary, North Carolina.
