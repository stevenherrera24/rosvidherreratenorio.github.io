<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I was born in Guatemala City in 1998 and lived there for the first
two years of my life. My mother had me as a teenager, and, at the same
time, my father dropped out of college so he could support our young
family. The circumstances that my parents faced, especially after the
birth of my younger sister the following year, placed them in an even
more precarious economic situation than they had experienced in their
young lives. My mother grew up in a three-generation-single mother
household (that is, my great grandmother, grandmother, and mother all
experienced growing up in a single motherhood household), and my father
was forced at a young age (around 11 years-old) to work as an auto
mechanic to support his family. Having understood these key moments in
their lives through conversations at the dinner table (and in various
lengthy documents that helped support our (continuing) immigration
status changes), it became very clear to me that it would take a lot of
courage, persistence, and luck to gain opportunities to ‘get out’ of my
class-disadvantaged position in the United States as an immigrant with a
precarious immigration status.</p>
<p>I grew up most of my life in a small, rural town in North Carolina
called Sanford, which is located in Lee County–a county named after
Confederate Leader, General Robert E. Lee. I attended Southern Lee High
School, a relatively newer public high school (with the rival and
longstanding alternate high school being Lee County High School), and
was fortunate enough to work with high school teachers that became, what
seems to me, outstanding mentors, despite the politics of immigration
that made communicating my struggles a worrisome endeavor. My
immigration status at the time had been a consistent barrier to my
educational pursuits, and I still remember the day I received a phone
call from the Admissions Director at the North Carolina School of
Science and Mathematics (a residential, 2-year high school program that
I was invited to apply for as the 2nd highest rank student, by GPA,
during my sophomore year) that despite being highly qualified, I would
not be able to complete my application because of my status. This moment
continues to be one of the most haunting experiences that my mom and I
still recall whenever we reflect on what my life would have looked like
had I given up trying. Luckily, the following year I had been admitted
to the North Carolina Governor’s School residential summer program–one
of the most prestigious in the state–and attended under admission to the
Mathematics program in 2016, where I conducted research on hyperbolic,
non-Euclidean spaces. Thanks to the program, I met wonderful and
highly-talented students that had a similar background to mine, and we
encouraged each other to apply for colleges that would support us
financially. I will never forget the memories of what it was like living
well-below the poverty line for most of my life, especially in the rural
South, and I thank the countless educators, coaches, mentors, and
friends that always pushed me to excel.</p>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>After graduating from Southern Lee High School, I attended Duke
University. Thankfully, I was accepted as a <a
href="https://ousf.duke.edu/merit-scholarships/david-m-rubenstein-scholarship/">David
M. Rubenstein Scholar</a>, which provided me a loan-free, fully-funded
educational experience, among many other resources. I completed summer
internships at the Waipā Foundation in Hanalei, Hawaii and at Twitter in
San Francisco, California, and completed a summer of research as an
assistant to <a
href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/Cecilia.Marquez">Hunt Family
Assistant Professor of History Cecilia Márquez</a>. I majored in
Statistical Science, where I have been trained in Bayesian methods,
advised by <a
href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/maria.tackett">Assistant
Professor of the Practice in Statistical Science Maria Tackett</a>, and
worked as a teaching assistant for five semesters in-a-row for the
“Introduction to Data Science” course (where for two of the semesters, I
co-taught a 75-minute lab). I received several awards throughout my time
at Duke, including the 1st Place Prize at Hack Duke in the Inequality
Division, the 2020 Excellence in Scholarship Award and 2021
Collaboration of the Year Award from the Duke Latinx Awards Ceremony,
and the Forever Duke Student Leadership Award from the Duke Alumni
Association. Two of these awards were related to a project I did back in
2018-2019, implementing the first-ever centralized hub of information
via an independent website for undocumented students at Duke.</p>
<p>During my senior year, I completed a thesis that examined theories of
neighborhood integration among Latin American immigrants in the U.S
South using latent class analysis. My primary advisor for the project
was <a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/scott.lynch">Professor of
Sociology Scott Lynch</a>, who offered an incredible amount of helpful
feedback, specifically focused on statistical methods. However, the idea
was inspired by lectures and discussions in <a
href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/eduardo.bonilla.silva">James B.
Duke Distinguished Professor of Sociology Eduardo Bonilla-Silva’s</a>
“Sociology of Racism in America” and “Racial Stratification” (at the
Ph.D. level) courses, and email exchanges with <a
href="https://sociology.unc.edu/people-page/ted-mouw/">UNC Professor of
Sociology Ted Mouw</a>, who very nicely allowed me to come meet with him
on UNC’s campus to talk about my project at its earlier stage. These
mentors and advisers, including several many others I have not listed,
have profoundly shaped the way I think about the world and continue to
navigate it, especially as a Ph.D. student following in their
footsteps.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was accepted to the University of California,
Berkeley’s joint Ph.D. program in Sociology and Demography as a
recipient of a Chancellor’s Fellowship. Some of my favorite courses that
I’ve taken include “Immigration and Incorporation”, “Race and Ethnic
Relations”, “Introduction to Population Thought”, “Classical Social
Theory”, and “Modern Social Theory”, among many others. I am also a
workshop member for the “Interdisciplinary Immigration Workshop”. And
lastly, I do a lot of work with <a
href="https://grad.berkeley.edu/graduate-diversity/current-grad-students/undocumented-graduate-student-resources/">UndocuGrads</a>
as the Diversity and Community Fellow and graduate student
representative for undocumented graduate students at UC-Berkeley, where
I also serve on several administrative-level councils and units.</p>
