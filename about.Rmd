# About Me

## Background

I was born in Guatemala City and lived in an impoverished, urban neighborhood for the first two years of my life. I immigrated to the U.S. soon after and moved across several cities on the east coast. For most of my life, I was raised in a small town in North Carolina called Sanford, which is about 45 minutes south of Raleigh. I attended public schools and was fortunate enough to gain acceptance to the North Carolina Governor's School summer program in 2016, where I attended for mathematics. Despite growing up well-below the poverty line most of my life, I made the best with what I had, and I thank the countless educators, coaches, and mentors in Sanford for always pushing me to excel.

## Education

After graduating from Southern Lee High School, I attended Duke University. Thankfully, I was accepted as a [David M. Rubenstein Scholar](https://ousf.duke.edu/merit-scholarships/david-m-rubenstein-scholarship/), which provided me a loan-free, fully-funded educational experience, among many other resources. I majored in Statistical Science at Duke, where I have been trained in Bayesian methods and highly encouraged to pursue independent, interdisciplinary research. I apply rigorous, quantitative methods to interesting social phenomena, which is how I was led to pursue a Sociology minor. During my senior year, I completed a thesis that examined theories of neighborhood integration among Latin American immigrants in the U.S. South using latent class analysis. The project, along the support from Professor Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, encouraged me to apply for Ph.D. programs in Sociology.

Fortunately, I was accepted to the University of California, Berkeley's joint Ph.D. program in Sociology and Demography as a recipient of a Chancellor's Fellowship. Further, I was awarded the Ford Foundation's Predoctoral Fellowship to support my studies.
