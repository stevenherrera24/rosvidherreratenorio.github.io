## Background

I was born in Guatemala City and lived in an impoverished, urban neighborhood for the first two years of my life. I immigrated to the U.S. soon after and moved across several cities on the east coast. For most of my life, I was raised in a small town in North Carolina called Sanford, which is about 45 minutes south of Raleigh. I attended public schools and was fortunate enough to gain acceptance to the North Carolina Governor's School summer program in 2016, where I attended for mathematics. Despite growing up well-below the poverty line most of my life, I made the best with what I had, and I thank the countless educators, coaches, and mentors in Sanford for always pushing me to excel.

## Education

After graduating from Southern Lee High School, I attended Duke University. Thankfully, I was accepted as a [David M. Rubenstein Scholar](https://rubensteinscholars.duke.edu/), which provided me a loan-free, fully-funded educational experience, among many other resources. I majored in Statistical Science at Duke, where I have been trained in Bayesian methods and highly encouraged to pursue independent, interdisciplinary research. I apply rigorous, quantitative methods to interesting social phenomena, which is how I was led to pursue a Sociology minor. During my senior year, I completed a thesis that examined theories of neighborhood integration among Latin American immigrants in the U.S. South using latent class analysis. The project, along the support from Professor Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, encouraged me to apply for Ph.D. programs in Sociology.

Fortunately, I was accepted to the University of California, Berkeley's joint Ph.D. program in Sociology and Demography as a recipient of a Chancellor's Fellowship. As I'm making sense of my interests, it is becoming increasingly clear that variable conceptualization and research design viability is hard to mesh together, and the quantitative approaches that I used to consider were more difficult to understand are not anymore. It is exciting to be in constant communication with my cohort in the Sociology Department, as their feedback is strongly challenging and making my thinking clearer. I'm also not as afraid of theory as I used to be, which is good, I guess.
